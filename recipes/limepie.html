        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon lime zest

        </li>
        <li>3 large egg yolks

        </li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream

        </li>
        <li>1 cup cold heavy cream

        </li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar

        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut rum

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor and add sugar. Pulse until coarsely ground. Add melted butter and pulse about 4 times until mixture resembles damp sand; transfer to a pie plate and very lightly press into bottom and up sides of the dish.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until fragrant, 4 to 6 minutes. Let cool.

        </li>
        <li>Whisk together sweetened condensed milk and lime juice until smooth. Whisk in egg yolks until well combined. Stir in sour cream and zest until smooth.

        </li>
        <li>Pour filling over graham cracker crust; lightly spread in an even layer. Place pie dish on a rimmed baking sheet.

        </li>
        <li>Bake  in the preheated oven until just set around the edges and slightly jiggly in the center, 14 to 16 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 40 minutes. Chill pie in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.

        </li>
        <li>Place cream, powdered sugar, and rum in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until cream holds medium peaks. Serve pie with whipped cream.
